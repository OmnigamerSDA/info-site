Following the Dragster saga and initial announcement of Speedrun Science, I had some moderate notoriety among a wider gaming audience. My focus on process and engineering principles in particular was picked up by some Google staff, who invited me to participate in Google's [Talks at Google](https://talksat.withgoogle.com/) lecture series. I developed a lecture and presentation, and delivered it at Google Cambridge on Dec 3, 2018. It was very well received, and a recording is available on YouTube.
