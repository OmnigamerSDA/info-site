Things started with just a few scattered articles, including my What is a Speedrun? discussion, but the core concept evolved over the years. The comprehensive guide was still the cornerstone, but I also started to research and conceptualize aspects of speedrunning's history and philosophy. Along the way, I found excellent production partners at Fangamer, and interviewed a number of relevant gaming personalities for their perspectives and experiences. Finally, in April 2019, Speedrun Science launched as the first major speedrunning book to very positive reviews. Pick up a copy today from [Fangamer](http://www.speedrunscience.com)!
