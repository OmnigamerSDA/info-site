Beyond Speedrun Science, I've also written a few articles discussing aspects of gaming and speedrunning.

* **[Momentum](https://smashboards.com/threads/momentum.179082/)** : a very early article I wrote describing metagame aspects of competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee. It was just a sum of my observations and musings at the time, though I think a fair bit of it still applies today. Written in about 2008.
* **[What is a Speedrun?](https://kb.speeddemosarchive.com/What_is_a_speedrun%3F)** : My first big speedrunning article that would serve as a prototype for some concepts explored in Speedrun Science. Covers aspects of formalizing a speedrun and some ancillary topics, such as glitch use and category creation.

I've also conducted a number of (non-scientific) surveys over the years for various reasons. These surveys propogated through Twitter, and got a lot of responses. The end results capture some of the pulse of the time period, and might be useful for getting perspectives on some of speedrunning's history.

* **Speedrunning Site Survey**: this survey looked for connections between the primary speedrunning sites and personal involvement in speedrunning. The original survey form is available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRFUxCUjtnV4DfWU9p8IswT0kalvqFpv4iym9g6cepdprX5w/viewform?usp=send_form), and my summary infographic of the results is [here](https://imgur.com/jiqrIoi).
* **Problems in Speedrunning**: the point of this survey was to identify needs and concerns across speedrunning as a whole. It sparked a lot of discussion and prompted many people to consider what they actually wanted from speedrunning. Original twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/TheOmnigamer/status/930192121897869313), form [here](https://www.strawpoll.me/14395422), and my reddit post discussing the results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/7cyu8r/what_are_the_big_problems_in_the_speedrunning/).
* **Controller Preferences**: this general survey aimed to identify which controller types people preferred, or actively disliked. This information informed my design decisions in MashAttack and earlier versions of Chimera, but is otherwise just interesting to note. Twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/TheOmnigamer/status/918262279224877056).
* **Monitor Latency Tests**: This was some independent technical testing I performed to measure latency of many commonly available monitors to see whether they were suitable for retro gaming. The general conclusion is that most are! Spreadsheet with the results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CHUlcAo2d0dEIf52I25S6ZNMphUSQopqYRBkKVJV9L0/edit?usp=sharing).
